# RDF Knowledge Graph Service API - Usage Examples and Case Studies

## Usage Examples

### 1. Retrieving Recommendations for a User
**Scenario**: A user logs in and requests personalized recommendations.

**API Call**:
```http
GET /recommendations?userID=12345
```

**Response**: A list of items recommended based on the user's profile and RDF knowledge graph.

### 2. Updating User Profile

{
  "socialMediaProfiles": ["Twitter/@user123"],
  "demographics": {"age": 30, "gender": "female", "location": "Iasi"},
  "hobbies": ["gaming", "reading"]
}
```

**Response**: Confirmation of the updated user profile.

### 3. Executing a SPARQL Query
**Scenario**: A developer wants to query the RDF graph for specific data.

**API Call**:
```http
POST /sparqlQuery
{
  "queryText": "SELECT * WHERE { ?s ?p ?o } LIMIT 10"
}
```

**Response**: The first 10 triples from the RDF graph.

## Pragmatic Case Studies

### Case Study 1: IT Team Formation
**Objective**: To form an IT team with specific skills and location preferences.

**Process**:
- User inputs desired skills (e.g., Web technologies, open hardware) and location preferences (Romania, Chile).
- The system uses the RDF knowledge graph to identify potential team members.
- Recommendations are provided through the `/recommendations` endpoint.

**Outcome**: The user receives a curated list of professionals matching the specified criteria.

### Case Study 2: Event Suggestion Based on User Preferences
**Objective**: To suggest events to users based on their hobbies and aversions.

**Process**:
- The user's profile indicates a love for classical music and a dislike for phone communications.
- The system queries the RDF graph for events matching these preferences.
- Relevant events are recommended, avoiding those that require extensive phone communication.

**Outcome**: The user gets event recommendations tailored to their interests and comfort.

### Case Study 3: Feedback-Driven Recommendation Improvement
**Objective**: Enhance recommendation accuracy using user feedback.

**Process**:
- After receiving recommendations, users provide feedback via the `/userFeedback` endpoint.
- This feedback is used to adjust the RDF graph and improve future recommendations.

**Outcome**: Over time, recommendations become more accurate and personalized for each user.
